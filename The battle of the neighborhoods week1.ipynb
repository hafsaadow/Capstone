    "For a business owner planning to open a new restaurant (or expanding an existing one) in a new city, knowing the restaurant type, cuisine and location with the potential to do well both physically and in social media ahead of time can be a game changer. This is beacuse it could solve the problem of uncertainty surrounding performance when breaking into new markets.\n",

All three cities boast a very diverse restaurant scene mostly due to their culturally diverse residents. However this analysis can be replicated on any city/number of cities and new business ideas (not limited to restaurants) to yield answers to similar important business decisions discussed here."
